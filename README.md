### Hello! I'm Roberto Ceraolo, thanks for being here!

I'm Italian, 23 years old, curious and energetic!

I am captivated by human ingenuity and the idea of empowering it with technology.

I am a Data Science student at EPFL in the beautiful Lausanne, Switzerland ‚õ∞Ô∏è

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on building a vector search retrieval system for Gamma Ray Logs (Earth subsurface measurements) at Schlumberger-Doll Research, Cambridge, MA

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about and exploring Retrieval Augumented Generation in Language Models, using LLamaIndex, DSPy, Langchain

üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate with an academic Lab on my Master's Thesis (starting february 2024). Ideally I would like to build LLM-based agents / tools.


## Some projects I've worked on recently:

[**Diffusion Models for Video Panoptic Segmentation**](https://github.com/roberto-ceraolo/video-panoptic-segmentation-DLAV)

Re-implementation of the whole codebase of Pix2Seq-D, a diffusion-based model to approach segmentation tasks, in Pytorch from Tensorflow, and adapted of the architecture to the task of Video Panoptic Segmentation.


[**Training an AI Assistant for STEM Education**](https://robertoceraolo.com/uploads/report_AI_assistant.pdf)

Development of an AI assistant specifically suited for STEM students. This included data gathering and preparation, training of a reward model (Deberta), fine-tuning of a large language model (Distilled GPT-2). Used the Antrophic-style Constitutional AI approach in order to bias the model towards providing clear, correct, complete, and rigourous answers.


[**OpenRitardi**](https://www.openritardi.it)

Development of a web app providing visualizations and search functionalities on train delays in Italy. The goal is to spread awareness about the quality of the service and prompt the company handling the railway system, to publish their data. 


[**Causal Representation learning**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HaRlDp_9VvhxFFeMhKfgNeOX-A8Opk8d/view?usp=sharing) 

Study with the goal of improving generalization capabilities of deep learning algorithms. Investigated the usage of Independence Regularization in Causal Representation Learning to increase the accuracy of a classifier on out-of-distribution data.
