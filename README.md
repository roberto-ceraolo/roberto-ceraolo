### Hello! I'm Roberto Ceraolo, thanks for being here!

I'm Italian, 24 years old, curious and energetic!

I am captivated by human ingenuity and the idea of empowering it with technology.

I am a Data Science student at EPFL in the beautiful Lausanne, Switzerland ‚õ∞Ô∏è

### Present

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on building a vector search retrieval system and generative models for Gamma Ray Logs (Earth subsurface measurements) at Schlumberger-Doll Research, Cambridge, MA. 

On occasion, I help startups, either on technical aspects, or on strategic decisions. Two of them, that I really care about, are [TextYess](https://www.textyess.com) (AI shopping assistant) and [PachinoRisparmio](https://pachinorisparmio.com) (Smart financial advisory).

Some projects I am trying to make time for, over my weekends:
- creating an open source community to build an European platform for Open Data on trains ([**OpenRitardi**](https://www.openritardi.it))
- creating a "steerable" text-2-CAD engine ([text2CAD](https://github.com/roberto-ceraolo/text-2-cad))

### Near future
The first half of 2024, I will be working on simulated environments and generative agents. I will be at ETH in Zurich, working with Zhijing Jin. Ideally, I would like to build a framework to run scientific experiments using simulations. [Here](https://robertoceraolo.com/post/simulacra/) you can find some of my thoughts on this topic. 

### Future
I am looking for a full time position starting August or September 2024. If you‚Äôre searching the best hyper-technical AI researcher, that‚Äôs not gonna be me. 

If you‚Äôre looking for someone that 
- has technical expertise in AI,
- is able to prioritize and put things in a customer-centric perspective,
- loves the 0 to 1 of building a product, 
then I might be your guy.


## Some projects I've worked on recently:

[**Fine-tuning an AI Assistant for STEM Education**](https://robertoceraolo.com/uploads/report_AI_assistant.pdf)

Development of an AI assistant specifically suited for STEM students. This included data gathering and preparation, training of a reward model (Deberta), fine-tuning of a large language model (Distilled GPT-2). Used the Antrophic-style Constitutional AI approach in order to bias the model towards providing clear, correct, complete, and rigourous answers.

[**Diffusion Models for Video Panoptic Segmentation**](https://github.com/roberto-ceraolo/video-panoptic-segmentation-DLAV)

Re-implementation of the whole codebase of Pix2Seq-D, a diffusion-based model to approach segmentation tasks, in Pytorch from Tensorflow, and adapted of the architecture to the task of Video Panoptic Segmentation.

[**OpenRitardi**](https://www.openritardi.it)

Development of a web app providing visualizations and search functionalities on train delays in Italy. The goal is to spread awareness about the quality of the service and prompt the company handling the railway system, to publish their data. 


[**Causal Representation learning**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HaRlDp_9VvhxFFeMhKfgNeOX-A8Opk8d/view?usp=sharing) 

Study with the goal of improving generalization capabilities of deep learning algorithms. Investigated the usage of Independence Regularization in Causal Representation Learning to increase the accuracy of a classifier on out-of-distribution data.
